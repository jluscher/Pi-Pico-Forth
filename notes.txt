            putkey seems to work without issue using putchar()

            serial_getchar does return with keystroke and EOF
            EOF was found to be -1 in the cygwin compilation
serial_getchar 194
    llkey 201
    
    
            serial_available may be useful?? for generating EOF?
            nope not needed serial_getchar DOES return EOF as -1
            but since serial_getchar is derived from Serial.read()
            it does not block without serial_available()
            AND therefore blocking in llkey never issues EOF
            
            AND this is true even for the script which never returns EOF
            So whats all this EOF shit anyway?
            
serial_available 195
    
    
            llkey tries to handle both keys and the init script, bull shit idea
            
llkey 198
    getkey 224
    
    
            suposedly getkey can return an EOF
            but - it returns lineBuffer[0] which is only written when llkey does not
            return EOF,... ?
            only returns the ':' or '\n' or '\r'
            hum,..
