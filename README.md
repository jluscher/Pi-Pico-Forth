Port(s) of Forth (simple) written in C.  Originally written by C.H.Ting, <-- Thank You!!

The "Original" is C.H.Ting's ceForth is to the best of my
understanding the original file. Note: it has problems. It is included
for completeness.

The Directory "Baseline Code" is my manipulation of the original to get it working in a CYG-WIN compilation.

Following Directories are the use of the Baseline Code in differing uPC environments and with different uPC(s).

For a long time I had been searching for a simple FORTH written in C.
Then I found this version, it is very minimal but seems to function.

Should you try this out and make improvements please inform me
