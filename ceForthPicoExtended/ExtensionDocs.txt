Many names need to be changed, these are old from the last forth version.
The SPI docs at the end of the file are correct, at least thru one set of tests.

SPI Flash Words, The chip allows for 100K Erase/sector
Note: Sectors are 4096 bytes, Pages are 256 bytes 16 per sector.
---
get_id                  ( - 64bits)     Returns 64bit SPI ID
sector_erase            (sec - )        Erase Sector (0->255) 1Mbyte == 256*4096
sector_store            (ptr sec pg - ) Store 256bytes(adr) in sec pg, adr is 32bit dpush()
page_list               (sec pg - )     List contents of sec pg. See this code in order to understand how to read a page.
pattern_page            (offset - ptr)  Writes (sec,pg) with ((0->255)+offset) & 0xFF), for testing
