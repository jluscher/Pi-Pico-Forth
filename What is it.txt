For a long time I had been searching for a simple FORTH written in C.
Then I found this version, it is very minimal but seems to function.
There are NO additions specific to the PICO like PIO control or
anything from the PICO SDK. It is just a starting point for further 
development. Watch this space for additions.

Upon invocation type <gpio> cr for a pin(s) state report.

Should you try this out and make improvements please inform me
at contact@eclektronix.com which is not my GITHUB registered email.
